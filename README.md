👋 Hey there! I'm Arif, a 21-year-old computer science student specializing in Computer Science and Business Systems, with a curriculum designed by TCS. As a perpetual learner, I'm always eager to dive into new technologies and expand my skill set.

💻 I have a solid foundation in C/C++, and I'm currently honing my skills in web development, mastering HTML/CSS, and delving into JavaScript for website design. Next up on my learning journey is React!

🚀 In my recent academic endeavors, I served as a team leader for Project CP1 during my fifth semester, where I led my team to success through effective collaboration and project management.

🌐 With a keen interest in web design, I enjoy exploring the latest trends and techniques in the field. I'm passionate about creating engaging user experiences and am always looking for opportunities to enhance my skills further.

🎓 Looking towards the future, I envision myself working with startups to gain invaluable experience in the tech industry before eventually venturing into entrepreneurship. But first, I'm excited to dive into the corporate world post-college to gain insights and expertise to fuel my entrepreneurial journey.

🔍 Let's connect and embark on this exciting tech journey together! Whether it's discussing new technologies, collaborating on projects, or sharing insights, I'm always up for a good tech chat. Happy coding! 🚀
